## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

By doing this project, i learnt how to use CSS gradients, CSS variables and CSS Pseudo-classes. 

### Continued development

- I want to focus on the responsiveness using flexbox.
- Plan the project properly before starting it like how the HTML structure should be formed, font sizes, containers, etc.
- Got to know about static and variable fonts. Have to learn how to use them.
